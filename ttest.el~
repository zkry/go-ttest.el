;;; Commentary:

;; go-ttest provides a number of utilities for working with table tests in Go.
;;
;; Table tests are a nice way to express variations of tests with
;; differing data but often times working with such tests can be cumbersome

;;; Code:

(message "Hello World!")

(provide 'ttest)

;;; ttest.el ends here
